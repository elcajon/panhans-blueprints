# 🔘 Thermostats & Sensors

## 🔥 Thermostats / Climates

In the first step, you need to specify your thermostats or the climate entities that your new AHC automation should control.

## 🎛️ Operation / HVAC Mode

Here you select the manual heating mode of your thermostats so that AHC can take full control. Usually, the manual HVAC mode is *heat*. However, for some thermostats this mode also stands for the boost mode and another mode like *auto* must be selected.
