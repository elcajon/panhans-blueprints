# 🪟 Windows & Doors Detection

To ensure your thermostats deactivate or lower the temperature when your doors or windows are open, you need to add your contact sensors here.

!!! info "Thermostats that do not support the *off* mode are automatically set to their minimum temperature."

## 🪟 Windows & Doors

Füge hier deine Türen und Fenster hinzu, auf die deine Automation reagieren soll.

## ⏳ Window & Door Reaction Time Open

Here you can set a time that your windows or doors must be open before your thermostats are lowered. This prevents the thermostats from lowering just because you briefly open the door, for example, to leave the house.

## ⌛ Window & Door Reaction Time Close

If your window briefly slams shut due to the wind or you want to wait a while until your room acclimatizes, you can set a duration here that the window must be closed before your thermostats are reset to their original state.

## 🌡️ Window Open Temperature

If you only want to lower your thermostats slightly when the window is open, for example, to save battery or because it is so cold that the pipes might freeze, you can set a temperature here that will be applied in this case.
